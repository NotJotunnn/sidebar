# Simple Sidebar
This is another project that is part from freecodecamp's yt channel! link: https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4

Very little javascript was necessary due to past projects.

At last, these challenges are in fact, made by myself, I really only take the base model from the original source referenced bellow!

## Reference:

## Practiced:
    1. Responsiveness
    2. Using scripted fonts from fontawesome
    3. Logo shadow by hand
    4. Animation
    5. Research (MDN docs)
